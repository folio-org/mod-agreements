/**
 * Grouping of acquisition unit IDs relevant to a specific user and restriction type.
 * Used to calculate the proper SQL conditions for access control. The unit sets are:
 * 1. `memberRestrictiveUnits`: Do restrict, but user is explicitly listed as a member.
 * 2. `nonMemberRestrictiveUnits`: Do restrict, and user is not a member â€” deny access.
 * These groupings are used to compute the allow/deny logic in generated SQL.
